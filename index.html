                Are you winning, son?<br>
                Yes thanks, Dad <br>
                And I thank you for coming and asking that <br>
                I appreciate you trying to <br>
                Ask me though you may not understand

            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                No Dad, the shame... <br>
                I just donated $3000 so this girl would say my  name <br>
                Forgive me for what I've done <br>
                I cannot believe that you've become a simp, son <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                Dad no, I'm not, and Dad it's taking its toll, a lot <br>
                3000 hours, I've played this game, joined a tournament today <br>
                And guess what Dad, I didn't win, Dad <br>
                So all I've done, Dad, has been for nothing, Dad <br>
                I'm feeling real bad, It isn't even, Dad <br>
                That I've not won, you see the thing is, Dad <br>
                It's stopped being that fun, being that fun  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm so sorry, you've seen me like this <br>
                I'm a failure maybе it's time to quit, but thanks for asking <br>
                At least I tried <br>
                Now lеave me alone to sit and cry (cry, cry)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                I've transcended <br>
                Beyond the need for dualistic notions of competitive <br>
                But I'm humbled, Dad, you came to me <br>
                So please come sit beside your son for a cup of tea
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                Not exactly <br>
                The only things I'm winning here is good old memories <br>
                Like all the good times, you knocked my door <br>
                Asking once again if I was winning like before
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Though things have changed now <br>
                And though it's sad <br>
                It's time for me to ask <br>
                "Are you winning, Dad?" <br>
                Even though I know that you are winning, Dad <br>
                When you asked me it meant I was winning, Dad

                Lately, I can't help but think <br>
                That our roads might take us down different phases <br>
                Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we've got <br>
                But I'm speechless <br>
                When everything's so pure, can it be aimless? <br>
                Painless?

                They don't matter now <br>

                All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly <br>
                Consider what we've got <br>
                'Cause I can never take you for granted <br>
                Is there another us on this whole planet? <br>

            <h2>Nightmares of a Warrior</h2>
            <p>Tales of Wudan</p>
            <p>(Tateshinkai)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On my 407th year atop Wudan <br>
                began a period of terrible nightmares. <br>
                Scenes of death and destruction.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I did not sleep for 20 human years. <br> 
                Despite embarrassment,  <br>
                I sought the council of Master Po.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “Master. You teach me the hidden styles of Wudan, <br>
                in a bid to make me a great warrior.  <br>
                Yet I can not sleep due to the sight of death, of destruction.  <br>
                I feel uneasy. I simply lie awake.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He replied in a whisper: <br>
                “You feel awake... alive, at the sight of battle, <br>
                and you doubt your skills as a warrior?”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Such is the way of Wudan.

            <h2>Peace Amongst the Trees</h2>
            <p>Tales of Wudan</p>
            <p>(Tateshinkai)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In a previous life, <br>
                I lived 5000 human years atop Wudan mountain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I remember every lived second.  <br>
                Life is competition.  <br>
                Competition is violence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In many modern forms of competition <br>
                we have attempted to water down the violent aspects, <br>
                to replicate violence in the most sanitised way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We have full grown men, <br>
                growing as large and strong as possible <br>
                - to put a ball in a net, <br>
                as opposed to hurting each other. <br>
                But the sentiment is the same. <br>
                It’s a group of men at war with another - <br>
                with one team being victors. <br>
                And the other being losers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The largest, strongest, most beautiful tree. <br>
                Violently crushed the surrounding saplings, <br>
                in the quest for resource.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Every time I see beauty, <br>
                I see the struggle required to create it. <br>
                When I see myself,  <br>
                I know the struggle lived to become who I am.  <br>
                To live as I do.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The more sophisticated my understanding <br>
                of the universes state of constant war  <br>
                - the happier, more content and peaceful I feel.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You are MEANT to struggle. <br>
                You are here to SUFFER.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you do neither of these things, <br>
                you are either dead or invisible. <br>
                If you want people to care who you are <br>
                - become familiar with pain. <br>
                If you do not struggle <br>
                to become an exceptional man. <br>
                You are a nobody. <br>
                And every female will prove to you <br>
                - you may as well not exist.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Evolution requires PAIN. <br>
                While others complain <br>
                they do not feel happy enough, <br>
                I’m happy I’m struggling. <br>
                I don’t want to be happy. <br>
                I want to be great. <br>
                This is the beauty of life as a MAN.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We are born valueless. <br>
                And you either build yourself into a King <br>
                - or you fail. <br>
                Atop Wudan, <br>
                I told priest master Yan Hui, <br>
                how at peace I felt amongst the trees. <br>
                I could feel life all around me. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sitting at the foot of the largest tree, <br>
                I asked him. <br>
                <em>“When life is so beautiful, why do we fight?”</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                His reply was simple. <br>
               <em>
                “Do you think the largest tree you sit beneath, <br>
                grew so tall amongst many, <br>
                if it didn’t fight?” <br>
               </em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Such is the way of Wudan.

            <h2>Straw Pillows</h2>
            <p>Tales of Wudan</p>
            <p>(Tateshinkai)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Atop Wudan, <br>
                the nights were always especially cold.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We would sleep on concrete floors <br>
                with straw pillows and blankets were forbidden. <br>
                Many of the students would opt to do their chores <br>
                in the middle of the night <br>
                in an attempt to stay warm and then try to steal sleep <br>
                during meditation in the warmer afternoons.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Of course Po was aware of this, <br>
                and every so often would <br>
                pluck a perpetrator from morning exercise <br>
                and beat him severely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It’s a risk many children took, <br>
                for it is very difficult to sleep when you are cold. <br>
                But I wanted to feel like a weapon. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Not to have a weapon or use a weapon <br>
                - I wanted to BE and FEEL like a weapon. <br>
                When I walk the streets, <br>
                I feel a way most men can never feel. <br>
                And to do that, <br>
                I have endured 10,000 cold nights. <br>
                When I had graduated as a Master of Wudan <br>
                I spent many years roaming from town to town. <br>
                One day I fell in love.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                She said  <br>
                she would stay with me forever, <br>
                sickness and health, no matter what.  <br>
                That I am the sword and she is the sheath, <br>
                and we need each other.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I believed her. <br>
                She believed her. <br>
                So I rented a small room. <br>
                Concrete floor and straw pillow. <br>
                I forbid us to touch <br>
                - only body heat can be shared.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                She asked how long we must do this for, <br>
                and my answer was simple: <br>
                “Until mastery is attained.” <br>
                When I woke the following morning she was gone. <br>
                I never saw her again.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I believe she loved me, <br>
                I believe she wanted me. <br>
                But there is a difference between <br>
                the wants and needs of a normal person, <br>
                and a Master such as myself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I hear others talk of love, <br>
                I pity them. <br>
                <em>How can you be in love on expensive holidays <br>
                    and sharing takeaway?</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <em>None of you are in Love. <br>
                Not to the standard of Wudan.</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>
                    Doubt me? Place her on a concrete floor, <br>
                    with a straw pillow.
                </em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Such is the way of Wudan.

                Five were called to watch the skies,
                But one stayed home, with doubting eyes.
                One came, but left when hope grew thin,
                One slept, the stars too slow to win.

                One blinked and missed the fire’s flight,
                But one stayed still through silent night—
                And saw a meteor blaze the air,
                A gift for those who choose to care.
