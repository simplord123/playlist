                Yes thanks, Dad <br>
                And I thank you for coming and asking that <br>
                I appreciate you trying to <br>
                Ask me though you may not understand

                Are you winning, son? <br>
                No Dad, the shame... <br>
                I just donated $3000 so this girl would say my  name <br>
                Forgive me for what I've done <br>
                I cannot believe that you've become a simp, son <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                Dad no, I'm not, and Dad it's taking its toll, a lot <br>
                3000 hours, I've played this game, joined a tournament today <br>
                And guess what Dad, I didn't win, Dad <br>
                So all I've done, Dad, has been for nothing, Dad <br>
                I'm feeling real bad, It isn't even, Dad <br>
                That I've not won, you see the thing is, Dad <br>
                It's stopped being that fun, being that fun  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm so sorry, you've seen me like this <br>
                I'm a failure maybе it's time to quit, but thanks for asking <br>
                At least I tried <br>
                Now lеave me alone to sit and cry (cry, cry)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                I've transcended <br>
                Beyond the need for dualistic notions of competitive <br>
                But I'm humbled, Dad, you came to me <br>
                So please come sit beside your son for a cup of tea
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Are you winning, son? <br>
                Not exactly <br>
                The only things I'm winning here is good old memories <br>
                Like all the good times, you knocked my door <br>
                Asking once again if I was winning like before
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Though things have changed now <br>
                And though it's sad <br>
                It's time for me to ask <br>
                "Are you winning, Dad?" <br>
                Even though I know that you are winning, Dad <br>
                When you asked me it meant I was winning, Dad

            <h2>Nightmares of a Warrior</h2>
            <p>Tales of Wudan</p>
            <p>(Tateshinkai)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On my 407th year atop Wudan <br>
                began a period of terrible nightmares. <br>
                Scenes of death and destruction.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I did not sleep for 20 human years. <br> 
                Despite embarrassment,  <br>
                I sought the council of Master Po.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “Master. You teach me the hidden styles of Wudan, <br>
                in a bid to make me a great warrior.  <br>
                Yet I can not sleep due to the sight of death, of destruction.  <br>
                I feel uneasy. I simply lie awake.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He replied in a whisper: <br>
                “You feel awake... alive, at the sight of battle, <br>
                and you doubt your skills as a warrior?”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Such is the way of Wudan.

            <h2>Peace Amongst the Trees</h2>
            <p>Tales of Wudan</p>
            <p>(Tateshinkai)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In a previous life, <br>
                I lived 5000 human years atop Wudan mountain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I remember every lived second.  <br>
                Life is competition.  <br>
                Competition is violence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In many modern forms of competition <br>
                we have attempted to water down the violent aspects, <br>
                to replicate violence in the most sanitised way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We have full grown men, <br>
                growing as large and strong as possible <br>
                - to put a ball in a net, <br>
                as opposed to hurting each other. <br>
                But the sentiment is the same. <br>
                It’s a group of men at war with another - <br>
                with one team being victors. <br>
                And the other being losers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The largest, strongest, most beautiful tree. <br>
                Violently crushed the surrounding saplings, <br>
                in the quest for resource.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Every time I see beauty, <br>
                I see the struggle required to create it. <br>
                When I see myself,  <br>
                I know the struggle lived to become who I am.  <br>
                To live as I do.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The more sophisticated my understanding <br>
                of the universes state of constant war  <br>
                - the happier, more content and peaceful I feel.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You are MEANT to struggle. <br>
                You are here to SUFFER.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you do neither of these things, <br>
                you are either dead or invisible. <br>
                If you want people to care who you are <br>
                - become familiar with pain. <br>
                If you do not struggle <br>
                to become an exceptional man. <br>
                You are a nobody. <br>
                And every female will prove to you <br>
                - you may as well not exist.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Evolution requires PAIN. <br>
                While others complain <br>
                they do not feel happy enough, <br>
                I’m happy I’m struggling. <br>
                I don’t want to be happy. <br>
                I want to be great. <br>
                This is the beauty of life as a MAN.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We are born valueless. <br>
                And you either build yourself into a King <br>
                - or you fail. <br>
                Atop Wudan, <br>
                I told priest master Yan Hui, <br>
                how at peace I felt amongst the trees. <br>
                I could feel life all around me. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sitting at the foot of the largest tree, <br>
                I asked him. <br>
                <em>“When life is so beautiful, why do we fight?”</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                His reply was simple. <br>
               <em>
                “Do you think the largest tree you sit beneath, <br>
                grew so tall amongst many, <br>
                if it didn’t fight?” <br>
               </em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Such is the way of Wudan.

            <h2>Straw Pillows</h2>
            <p>Tales of Wudan</p>
            <p>(Tateshinkai)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Atop Wudan, <br>
                the nights were always especially cold.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We would sleep on concrete floors <br>
                with straw pillows and blankets were forbidden. <br>
                Many of the students would opt to do their chores <br>
                in the middle of the night <br>
                in an attempt to stay warm and then try to steal sleep <br>
                during meditation in the warmer afternoons.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Of course Po was aware of this, <br>
                and every so often would <br>
                pluck a perpetrator from morning exercise <br>
                and beat him severely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It’s a risk many children took, <br>
                for it is very difficult to sleep when you are cold. <br>
                But I wanted to feel like a weapon. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Not to have a weapon or use a weapon <br>
                - I wanted to BE and FEEL like a weapon. <br>
                When I walk the streets, <br>
                I feel a way most men can never feel. <br>
                And to do that, <br>
                I have endured 10,000 cold nights. <br>
                When I had graduated as a Master of Wudan <br>
                I spent many years roaming from town to town. <br>
                One day I fell in love.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                She said  <br>
                she would stay with me forever, <br>
                sickness and health, no matter what.  <br>
                That I am the sword and she is the sheath, <br>
                and we need each other.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I believed her. <br>
                She believed her. <br>
                So I rented a small room. <br>
                Concrete floor and straw pillow. <br>
                I forbid us to touch <br>
                - only body heat can be shared.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                She asked how long we must do this for, <br>
                and my answer was simple: <br>
                “Until mastery is attained.” <br>
                When I woke the following morning she was gone. <br>
                I never saw her again.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I believe she loved me, <br>
                I believe she wanted me. <br>
                But there is a difference between <br>
                the wants and needs of a normal person, <br>
                and a Master such as myself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I hear others talk of love, <br>
                I pity them. <br>
                <em>How can you be in love on expensive holidays <br>
                    and sharing takeaway?</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <em>None of you are in Love. <br>
                Not to the standard of Wudan.</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>
                    Doubt me? Place her on a concrete floor, <br>
                    with a straw pillow.
                </em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Such is the way of Wudan.

                "Eyes to the Sky"<br>
                Five were called to watch the skies,
                But one stayed home, with doubting eyes.
                One came, but left when hope grew thin,
                One slept, the stars too slow to win.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One blinked and missed the fire’s flight,
                But one stayed still through silent night—
                And saw a meteor blaze the air,
                A gift for those who choose to care.
